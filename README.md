# Analysis of CLF WBLCA Benchmark Study v2

This repo contains some studies on the data collected, prepared, and published as part of the Carbon Leadership Forum (CLF) WBLCA Benchmark Study v2. You can find a link to their repo [here](https://github.com/Life-Cycle-Lab/wblca-benchmark-v2-data), where you can also learn more about the contents of the data and find link to additional resources there as well.

I have included copies of the buildings_metadata.xlsx and data_glossary.xlsx files in this repo as well. These are exactly the same and unedited as the ones shared by CLF, but have been copied over here for convenience of anyone looking to quickly replicate the studies done in the jupyter notebook here.
